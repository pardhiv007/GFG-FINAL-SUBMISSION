                <li>1½ tbsp cumin seeds</li>
                <li>250g moong dhal</li>
                <li>250g medium or short grain rice (basmati is also fine)</li>
                <li>1½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 medium-sized tomato, cut into 1cm cubes</li>
                <li>150g frozen peas</li>
                <li>½ tsp asafoetida</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>2½ tbsp ghee</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>1 dried red chilli</li>
                <li>3 cardamom pods, seeds removed and crushed, husks discarded</li>
                <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>  
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toast 1 tbsp of the cumin seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat until the aromas are released. Allow to cool and then put in a coffee or spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. This will make about 4 tsp of ground cumin, of which ½ tsp will be used at the end of the dish. The remainder will keep in an airtight container for up to a week for use in another dish.</li>
                <li>Dry toast the moong dhal in a frying pan over a medium heat for about 5 mins. Keep tossing the pan so the dhal does not burn. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Gently wash the rice under cold water two to three times to remove the starch. Add the dry-roasted moong dhal to the rice and wash once again. Put both in a large ovenproof pan and fill with enough water to come 1½ inches above the rice mixture. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Spoon off any scum that forms on top of the water and discard it.</li>
                <li>Stir in the ground turmeric and tomato, return to a simmer, then pour in 500ml water. Return to a rolling simmer, reduce the heat and simmer for a further 20 mins with the lid on. Check the dhal and rice are cooked – they should have merged together to form a porridge-like consistency. Add more water if necessary and simmer for longer. Once cooked, keep on a low heat and add the frozen peas, asafoetida, 1 tsp salt and sugar. Stir in well and keep on a gentle simmer.</li>
                <i>Meanwhile, put a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of the ghee, the remaining cumin seeds, bay leaf, dried chilli and crushed cardamom seeds, and allow the aromas to release, taking care not to burn the spices, around 2-3 mins. Add the ginger and cook for 2 mins on a medium heat, stirring constantly so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Stir the ginger and cumin mixture into the khichdi and simmer for a final 2 mins before removing from the heat. Drop the last ½ tbsp ghee over the top and sprinkle with ½ tsp of the toasted and ground cumin seeds (also known as bhaja moshla). Close the lid until ready to serve. Just before serving, stir well one more time and the khichdi is ready to be served hot. </i>

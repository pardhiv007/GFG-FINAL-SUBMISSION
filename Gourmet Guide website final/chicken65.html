            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Dry-toast the cumin seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Cool then put in a coffee or spice grinder and grind into a fine powder. Set aside. Cut the chicken thighs into quarters and combine in a mixing bowl with the yogurt, lime juice and 1½ tsp salt. Mix well. Mix in the grated ginger, garlic, 1 tsp ground black pepper, chopped curry leaves, chopped coriander, deggi mirch, amchoor powder (if using), sugar, 1 tbsp of the rapeseed oil and tomato ketchup. Mix well to ensure all the chicken pieces are thoroughly coated. Cover the bowl with and keep chilled for 3 hrs.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the fridge and leave for 30 mins. Stir in the rice flour and the roasted cumin powder mixture from step 1, and stir well.</li>
                <li>Fill a large pan three-quarters full with oil and heat to 180C or until the batter sizzles when a little is dropped in. Take each piece of chicken individually and gently slide into the pan. Take care not to cook too many pieces in one go. The pieces should be bubbling when in the oil. Allow to cook for 3-4 mins, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat for all the chicken pieces and set aside.</li>
                <li>Put the remaining 2 tbsp rapeseed oil in a wok or karai and heat over a medium-high heat. Add the slit chillies, chopped garlic and curry leaves. Take care as the ingredients may pop. Cook for 1 min, then add the fried chicken and gently toss. Stir well for another minute to coat the chicken. Remove from the heat and serve with lime wedges on the side.</li>
